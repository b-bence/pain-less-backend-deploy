# PainLess

The application is fully deployed, check the live version here:
- https://pain-less.netlify.app/

This is the backend of a web-application, which was made to give you exercise routines for strengthening and stretching your back and core, and therefore ease any pain related to these areas, and improve your posture. There are some previously generated workout routines, but you can create custom workout plans using the exercise library. 
The project's frontend repository is available here: https://github.com/veronka21/pain-less-frontend

## Project status

This is the backend part of an Angular project, which will be a fitness web-application designed for people with back pain issues. There will be pre-built exercise routines, available from the backend database, and the user can also make custom plans from the exercises, which are viewed on cards, showing a gif of an exercise and the cards can be flipped to get written instructions. Custom plans will also be stored at the backend.
Future plans also include tracking the training history, and setting training goals.

- Spring/Spring boot
- Hibernate
